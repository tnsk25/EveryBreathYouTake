# EveryBreathYouTake-WebVisualisation
The application analyses the Air Quality data for different states and counties across the US from 1990-2018. 
The Air Quality data has been categorized into Annual, Daily, Hourly data files. The application analyses the 
same data in multiple ways (Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, HeatMap, Table) to derive insights from the 
changing trends over the years. Apart from analysing the Air Quality for the US, this application also 
analyses the Air Quality data for Hong Kong as well. We have experimented with different layouts 
considering user experience as well.
